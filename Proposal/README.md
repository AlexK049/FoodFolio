# Food Folio

## 1. The problem or need Food Folio addresses:
The dining experience isn't just about eating anymore; it's about the overall experience, the ambiance, the quality of service, the unique taste of dishes and drinks, and the stories we associate with these experiences. Most current restaurant review platforms focus mainly on general reviews, ratings, and occasionally, pictures.

There's a gap when it comes to:
- **Detailed, dish-specific reviews**
- **Personal food journey tracking**

Food Folio addresses these needs, allowing users to document, revisit, and share their specific food and drink experiences.

## 2. Target Users for Food Folio:
**Why would they use the app?**

- **Food Enthusiasts**: Individuals who love exploring different cuisines and dishes. They often visit different restaurants and are eager to share their experiences.

- **Travelers**: Those who often find themselves in unfamiliar locations and rely on restaurant reviews. They would use FoodFolio to discover authentic local experiences based on individual dish reviews.

- **Casual Diners**: Those who occasionally dine out and want a platform to record a special dish or drink, ensuring they remember it for the next time.

- **Community-driven food explorers**: People preferring community-driven recommendations over commercial ads would lean towards Food Folio for genuine, dish-specific feedback.
